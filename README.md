# BabelAI
A symbolic AI approach to NLP with minimal rules and a focus on formalization of contextual language acquisition.

The purpose of this project is for me to learn Zig and see if my intuition about the best potential approach to NLP is correct.

## Installing dependencies

The main dependency of this project is Zig.

### macOS
Installing Zig through `brew install` on macOS works fine.

### Windows
Installing Zig through `winget` doesn't work. Instead you should download the zip and add it to your PATH env var manually.

## Running the project

In the root folder of the project, execute `zig build run`.
